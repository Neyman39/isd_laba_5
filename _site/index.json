    "keywords": "About This Project This project contains source code analysis and cleanup rules for xUnit.net. Analysis and fixes are only supported with C#. Requirements: xUnit.net v2 2.0+. Supported in Visual Studio 2019 16.11+ or 2022 17.4+ (as well as via command line builds with Roslyn 3.11+). Other environments (such as Mono or JetBrains Rider) may be able to use these analyzers as well; support and issue resolution will be provided by those third parties and not by xUnit.net itself. Documentation: a list of supported rules is available at https://xunit.net/xunit.analyzers/rules/ Bugs and issues: please visit the core xUnit.net project issue tracker. Building: see BUILDING.md. How to install xUnit.net v2 2.3.0 and higher: the analyzer package is referenced by the main xunit NuGet package out of the box. If you choose to reference xunit.core instead, you can reference xunit.analyzers explicitly. xUnit.net v2 2.2.0 and earlier: you have to install the xunit.analyzers NuGet package explicitly. How to uninstall If you installed xUnit.net v2 2.3.0 or higher and do not wish to use the analyzers package, replace the package reference to xunit with the corresponding versions of xunit.core and xunit.assert Analysis and Code Fix in Action Latest Builds Stable Latest CI Build status v2 core framework v3 core framework xunit.analyzers xunit.runner.visualstudio For complete CI package lists, please visit the feedz.io package search.
